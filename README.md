# NetflixDataAnalysis
Data Visualization for Netflix TV Shows and Movies 

This data analysis is part of my project submission for the Python course - [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](zerotopandas.com). As a part of the course, I have learnt how to conduct data visualization and exploratory data analysis using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

I have picked up a dataset that consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. I have downloaded this from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows.

With this dataset I plan to explore the distribution of Netflix content across Countries, Release Year and Directors. I have cleaned the data before diving into the analysis.
